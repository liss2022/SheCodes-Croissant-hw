    <h1>Croissant Page</h1>
    <p>
      This is a page about Croissants. I like croissants. Especially, the ones
      filled with chocolate. It goes well with hot chocolate or coffee.

    <h2>Croissants</h2>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for their
      historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of a
      layered yeast-leavened dough
